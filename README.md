Watch Dogs 2 Data

## What the project does
This Project is made to help Watch Dogs 2 mod developers find the correct data for their project e.g. the correct character model or vehicle.

## Why the project is useful
The Project is useful because the is no other site (that I know, please correct me if I am wrong!) that offers a list of all character models, vehicles, weather types, or lma layers (all with previews).
   
## How users can get started with the project
The project is not yet released but the link to the website will be added later.

## Where users can get help with your project
If you need help please open an issue.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
At the moment the project is maintained by me (Nickwasused).
